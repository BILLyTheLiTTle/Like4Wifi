This application is a Java Servlet which works as a phising application to retrieve the Facebook accounts' credentials. It is created for demonstration purposes only and you should not use it for stealing people's credentials.

I don't know if I am going to improve it at the near future (I know the FB logo is not right) but as I said this app was written for demonstration purposes and of course for fun. It is written using Eclipse so you can modify it by yourself as you wish. Send me your commits if you want to, to merge them with the initial project!

I am not going to guide you how to use it, but I assure you that the whole experiment, was conducted using my Android phone and ONLY. Thanks Samsung for the powerful Note 3 device!!!
